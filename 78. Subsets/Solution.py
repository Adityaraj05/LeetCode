class Solution:
    def subsets(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        # This line initializes a variable result with a list containing one empty list []
        result = [[]]
        # iterates over each element in the nums list. The variable num will take on each value in the nums list in each iteration of the loop.
        for num in nums:   #[1,2,3]
        # method for generating all possible combinations of elements from the input list nums. It iterates over each element in nums, and for each element, it appends that element to every existing combination in the result list, effectively creating new combinations. This is achieved using list comprehension, where for each existing combination i in the result list, the current element num is appended to it, creating a new combination. These new combinations are then added to the result list. 
            result += [i + [num] for i in result]
        return result
