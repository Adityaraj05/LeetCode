Example:
Let's take the example array nums = [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6] and k = 4.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
Check divisibility by k:

python
Copy code
if len(nums) % k != 0:
    return False
Length of nums is 8.
8 % 4 == 0, so we proceed.
Count the occurrences of each integer:

python
Copy code
counter = collections.Counter(nums)  # Counter({3: 2, 4: 2, 1: 1, 2: 1, 5: 1, 6: 1})
We use collections.Counter to count the frequency of each number.
For nums = [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6], the counter will be:
python
Copy code
Counter({3: 2, 4: 2, 1: 1, 2: 1, 5: 1, 6: 1})
Process each unique number in sorted order:

python
Copy code
for num in sorted(counter):
We sort the keys of the counter to process the numbers in ascending order: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].
Retrieve the frequency of the current integer and form groups:

python
Copy code
for num in sorted(counter):
    frequency = counter[num]
    if not frequency:
        continue
    for i in range(k):
        if counter[num + i] < frequency:
            return False
        counter[num + i] -= frequency
Let's go through the iterations in detail:

First Iteration (num = 1):

frequency = counter[1] = 1
Try to form a group starting with 1: [1, 2, 3, 4]
counter[1] >= 1 → true → decrement counter[1] by 1
counter[2] >= 1 → true → decrement counter[2] by 1
counter[3] >= 1 → true → decrement counter[3] by 1
counter[4] >= 1 → true → decrement counter[4] by 1
Updated counter: Counter({3: 1, 4: 1, 5: 1, 6: 1, 1: 0, 2: 0})
Second Iteration (num = 2):

frequency = counter[2] = 0 → skip to next number.
Third Iteration (num = 3):

frequency = counter[3] = 1
Try to form a group starting with 3: [3, 4, 5, 6]
counter[3] >= 1 → true → decrement counter[3] by 1
counter[4] >= 1 → true → decrement counter[4] by 1
counter[5] >= 1 → true → decrement counter[5] by 1
counter[6] >= 1 → true → decrement counter[6] by 1
Updated counter: Counter({1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 0, 4: 0, 5: 0, 6: 0})
Subsequent Iterations (num = 4, 5, 6):

frequency = 0 for all → skip to next number.
Return True if all groups are formed successfully:

python
Copy code
return True
Since we successfully formed the groups [1, 2, 3, 4] and [3, 4, 5, 6] and all frequencies are zero, the function returns True.
Summary:
The function successfully checks if the array can be divided into groups of size k with consecutive integers by:

Checking divisibility by k.
Counting occurrences of each integer.
Iteratively forming groups starting from the smallest integer.
Ensuring enough integers are available to form each group.
Returning True if all groups are formed, otherwise False.
