101. Symmetric Tree

Given the root of a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (i.e., symmetric around its center).

 

Example 1:
![symtree1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ff37bcf1-50bc-4cbb-92a5-364683b187ef)


Input: root = [1,2,2,3,4,4,3]
Output: true
Example 2:
![symtree2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f50775c-cd1c-4e52-89e5-94e709a974c2)


Input: root = [1,2,2,null,3,null,3]
Output: false
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 1000].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
 

Follow up: Could you solve it both recursively and iteratively?
