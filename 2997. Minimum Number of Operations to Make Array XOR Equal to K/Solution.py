    def minOperations(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        # This line initializes the variable bit to 0. The variable will be used to accumulate the result of XOR operations.
        bit = 0 
        # This line starts a loop over each element a in the list nums.
        for a in nums:
            # Inside the loop, the current element a is XOR-ed with bit. The XOR operation (^) is a bitwise operator that returns 1 if the bits of the operands are different, and 0 if they are the same. So, as this line executes for each element, bit accumulates the result of XOR-ing all elements of nums together.
            bit ^= a
            # After XOR-ing all elements in nums, the result is then XOR-ed with another variable k. This is again applying the XOR operation, possibly integrating or comparing this result with another value k.
        bit ^= k
        # Here, we initialize a variable count to 0. This variable will be used to count the number of set bits (1-bits) in the final bit value.
        count = 0
        # This while loop continues as long as bit is greater than 0. The loop is used to count how many 1's (set bits) are in the binary representation of bit.
        while bit > 0:
            # Inside the loop, bit % 2 computes the remainder when bit is divided by 2, which effectively checks the least significant bit of bit. If bit is odd, bit % 2 is 1 (indicating a set bit), and if bit is even, bit % 2 is 0. The result is added to count.
            count += (bit % 2)
            # This line divides bit by 2 using integer division and assigns the result back to bit, effectively shifting the bits of bit right by one position. This moves the next bit into the least significant position for checking in the next iteration of the loop.
            bit //= 2
            # After the loop finishes (when all bits of bit have been shifted out and examined), the function returns the count of 1's in the binary representation of the final XOR result.
        return count
