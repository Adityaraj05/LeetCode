Example:
Dictionary: ["cat", "bat", "rat"]
Sentence: "the cattle was rattled by the battery"
Step-by-Step Execution:
Create a Set from the Dictionary:

python
Copy code
s = set(dictionary)
# s becomes: {"cat", "bat", "rat"}
Split the Sentence into Words:

python
Copy code
words = sentence.split()
# words becomes: ["the", "cattle", "was", "rattled", "by", "the", "battery"]
Initialize an Empty List for the Answer:

python
Copy code
ans = []
Iterate Over Each Word and Process It:

First Word: "the":

temp = "", found = False
Iterate over characters:
temp = "t", not in s
temp = "th", not in s
temp = "the", not in s
Since no prefix found, add "the" to ans.
ans = ["the"]
Second Word: "cattle":

temp = "", found = False
Iterate over characters:
temp = "c", not in s
temp = "ca", not in s
temp = "cat", found in s
Add "cat" to ans.
ans = ["the", "cat"]
Third Word: "was":

temp = "", found = False
Iterate over characters:
temp = "w", not in s
temp = "wa", not in s
temp = "was", not in s
Since no prefix found, add "was" to ans.
ans = ["the", "cat", "was"]
Fourth Word: "rattled":

temp = "", found = False
Iterate over characters:
temp = "r", not in s
temp = "ra", not in s
temp = "rat", found in s
Add "rat" to ans.
ans = ["the", "cat", "was", "rat"]
Fifth Word: "by":

temp = "", found = False
Iterate over characters:
temp = "b", not in s
temp = "by", not in s
Since no prefix found, add "by" to ans.
ans = ["the", "cat", "was", "rat", "by"]
Sixth Word: "the" (similar to the first word):

temp = "", found = False
Iterate over characters:
temp = "t", not in s
temp = "th", not in s
temp = "the", not in s
Since no prefix found, add "the" to ans.
ans = ["the", "cat", "was", "rat", "by", "the"]
Seventh Word: "battery":

temp = "", found = False
Iterate over characters:
temp = "b", not in s
temp = "ba", not in s
temp = "bat", found in s
Add "bat" to ans.
ans = ["the", "cat", "was", "rat", "by", "the", "bat"]
Join the Processed Words into a Sentence:

python
Copy code
return ' '.join(ans)
# Output: "the cat was rat by the bat"
Summary:
For each word in the sentence, the code checks if any prefix of the word is in the dictionary.
If a prefix is found, it replaces the word with this prefix.
If no prefix is found, it keeps the word as it is.
Finally, the list of processed words is joined into a single string and returned.
