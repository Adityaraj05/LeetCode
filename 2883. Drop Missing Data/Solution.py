def dropMissingData(students: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    # The .dropna() method is the key part of the code. It's used to deal with missing data, which is represented by NaN (Not a Number) in pandas. The code calls this method on the DataFrame students (assuming it's already defined elsewhere) with the following arguments:subset = ['name']: This argument specifies that the method should only consider the column named "name" when checking for missing values. Rows where the value in the "name" column is missing (i.e., None) will be dropped from the resulting DataFrame.
    return students.dropna(subset = ['name'])
